# Random Sentence Logger - Documentation

## Overview
The Random Sentence Logger is a Python-based project that generates and logs random sentences at varying intervals and log levels. It utilizes a configuration file and a JSON file to build the sentences and store them in log files for analysis.

## Key Concepts Learned
- Python Logging: Learned how to configure logging for both console and file output with varying log levels.
- Config Parsing: Used `configparser` to manage settings in a `.ini` file.
- JSON Data Management: Handled JSON files to read sentence components.
- Random Sentence Generation: Combined multiple data points to generate unique sentences.
- Matplotlib for Log Visualization: Applied plotting techniques to visualize log data.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (v3.9+)
- `logging`, `configparser`, `json`, `random`
- `matplotlib`, `numpy` for visualizations

## Summary
This project provided hands-on experience with logging, configuration management, and data visualization, enhancing my ability to handle dynamic logging and plotting tasks.
